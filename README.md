# city-growth

This is a simulation created in MATLAB to investigate the population dynamics in a nation, created as a project in the course *Simulation of Complex Systems* at the [Chalmers University of Technology](http://www.chalmers.se/), GÃ¶teborg, Sweden.

The inspiration came from

The hierarchial network of cities retrieved after 40 000 iterations by the model based on growth rate rather than population size di-
rectly.
